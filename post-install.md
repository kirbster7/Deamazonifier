You can download various customization apps from either Aurora Store or Droid-ify.

- [Wallpapers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wallpaper&hl=en_US) from Aurora Store

- [Simple Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/packages/rkr.simplekeyboard.imputmethod/) from Droid-ify
- An icon pack of your choice from any store

## Configuration

If you downloaded all of the apps above, you are ready to configure each of your apps to your liking. 

### Lawnchair
Lawnchair Settings is where I usually go first. You can change the icon shape and icon pack from here, among many other options. You might want to disable the shade gesture if you are using Power Shade. 

You can adjust grid sizes, icon sizes, and more. Arrange icons on the home screen grid to your liking.

### Power shade
Open the power shade app. It might prompt you to buy VIP, dont. Press the X in the corner and follow the on-screen instructions to continue. After following the instructions, you can customize the look and behavior in the app. 

### Wallpapers
Open the Wallpapers app. You should immediately be able to look through a catalog of wallpapers and choose one. 

### Simple Keyboard
Open the app and it will immediately prompt you to enable it in settings. Once done, you can use the Simple Keyboard app to customize your keyboard. 

### Google news feed
If you installed the Google app, you can swipe to the left on the home screen to get a personalized news feed.
