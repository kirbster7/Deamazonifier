## Apps
You will see 5 new apps in the app drawer.

 | **App** | **Description** | 
 | :--- | :----------- |
 | Aurora Store | A Play Store frontend used to download apps. | 
 | Droid-ify | A F-Droid frontend used to download FOSS apps. | 
 | Play Store | The default App Store for android. Don't use this. |
 | Lawnchair Settings | A settings panel for the launcher (home screen). | 
 | Via Browser | A privacy-focused web browser. | 

These apps will help you customize your tablet.

You can download various customization apps from either Aurora Store or Droid-ify.
