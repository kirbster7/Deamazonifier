# Deamazonifier
A basic program that fixes (almost) everything wrong with Amazon Fire tablets

## Installation
First, download the src folder from this directory.
After that, run the `on.sh` script.
Just wait for it to get done, and enjoy your bloat-free tablet!

## Compatability
Currently, Deamazonifier has only been tested on an Amazon Fire HD8 10th generation (2020). 
It might work on others, but use it at your own risk.
You can submit if it is working on your model by going to our discord: https://discord.gg/vHpPbfKhQY.
