# Deamazonifier NT Branch
A basic program built for Windows that fixes (almost) everything wrong with Amazon Fire tablets

> :warning: **WARNING:** This is not guaranteed to work on your device. Join my discord server to get a list of supported devices.

## Installation
First, download the src folder from this directory.
Then, enable developer options and USB debugging, and plug your tablet into your computer.
After that, run
```batch
.\de.bat
```
Just wait for it to get done, and enjoy your bloat-free tablet!

## Removing
This isn't finished, factory reset your device to remove the modifications

Just run 
```batch
.\de.bat
```

## Compatability
Currently, Deamazonifier has only been tested on an Amazon Fire HD8 10th generation (2020). 
It might work on others, but use it at your own risk.
You can submit if it is working on your model by going to my discord. https://notkirb.com/dc
