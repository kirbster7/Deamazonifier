# Deamazonifier
A basic program that fixes (almost) everything wrong with Amazon Fire tablets

## Installation
First, download the src folder from this directory.
After that, run the `on.sh` script.
Just wait for it to get done, and enjoy your bloat-free tablet!

## Compatability
Currently, my program has only been tested on an Amazon Fire HD8 10th generation (2020). 
It might work on others, but use it at your own risk.
