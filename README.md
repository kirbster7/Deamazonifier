# Deamazonifier NT Branch
A basic program built for Windows that fixes (almost) everything wrong with Amazon Fire tablets

## Installation (NOT FINAL)
First, download the src folder from this directory.
Then, enable developer options and USB debugging, and plug your tablet into your computer.
After that, run
```batch
.\de.bat /on
```
Just wait for it to get done, and enjoy your bloat-free tablet!

Note: the adb binary included with this is for Darwin kernel. If you are using the Linux kernel, replace the included adb binary with one compiled for the Linux kernel.

## Removing
Just run 
```batch
.\de.bat /off
```

## Compatability
Currently, Deamazonifier has only been tested on an Amazon Fire HD8 10th generation (2020). 
It might work on others, but use it at your own risk.
You can submit if it is working on your model by going to my discord. https://notkirb.com/dc
